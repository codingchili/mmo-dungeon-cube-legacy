The Mage uses spells to fend of the enemy and protect their allies. The typical mage does not engage in melee combat
and will cast their spells from a safe distance of their enemy.
       
    Protectionism/Empowerism
      As a Mage you can choose this supportive playstyle, where you have access to a number of buffs,
      that will make your allies and yourself stronger and tougher in combat.
    
    Healing,
      You may choose to play as a healer, mending damage dealt to yourself and your allies. There is no friendly fire
      so you may heal a boss your enemy is fighting, should you want. The healer combines well with protection magics from 
      the Supportive mage and/or thieves/warriors for damage.
    
    Chaos,
      The mages offensive playstyle consists of a few powerful spells that may damage enemies in an area.
      The offensive playstyle also contains some spells/abilities that can be used in close quarters.
      These abilities goes well with some of the protective spells from the Supportive school.
