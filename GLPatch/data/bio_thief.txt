The Thief uses agility and shadows to evade their enemy, the common Thief can deal high amounts of damage in short 
periods before backing off. Entering and leaving the battle to stay alive, traps, poison and drain.

    Huntsman,
      As a Thief you may play the huntsman game, you enjoy the woods and the animals within. Knows where to place traps
      for maximum yield. The huntsman blends in the nature at night. May call for wolves at higher levels.

    Assassin,
      The assasin lurks in the shadows and moves in for the kill. The most mobile profession. Entering and leaving
      stealth is what he does best. If you play the assasin style you will apply poisons and venoms with your shivs. 
      The assasin may use backstab while in stealth, which deals bonus physical damage.

    Marksman,
      You have sharp sight, shooting many arrows for maximum damage. The marksman has less utility than the assassin 
      and huntsman. The marksman makes up for lost agility with many types of arrows, shot in many different ways. If 
      you play the thief as a marksman, you do well combining abilities from assasin or huntsman for more mobility.
