You may combine spells/abilities from different types of your selected profession in any way you like.
Learning spells of one type does not limit your spellcasting, selecting more spells of a single type will 
later unlock a stronger ability that defines your playstyle.

   At higher levels every profession is eligible to learn low-tier abilities from another profession.
