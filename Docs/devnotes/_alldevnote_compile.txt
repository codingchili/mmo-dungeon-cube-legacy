+ enable on hover to see player health
+ on disconnect messages (remove player at enter charselect!)
+ set "lastbroadcasthealth" "thsihealth" > updateDelta (1% of health) sendMPAttributeUpdateToAll
	using: clients does not need to calculate regen/tick dmg, and risk losing sync.
	this value should only be updated for health regen/not direct damage
+ on connect messages (receive character list on connect.)
+ on player death set x:y
+ on player connect set additional attributes
+ fix spawn points, single map for test pls, Warrior? also dont spawn outside map
+ fix a bug that causes multiple connects sometimes/spawn point bug
+ wrong player dies/cannot cast spell/npc bug

+ find out why experience is not awarded for every kill and fix it [wasnot setting update in char]
+ did some work on a website, content required.
+ asynchronous hello message (udp)
+ fix the sort serverlist bug
+ fixed a bug that caused any license longer than 25 chars to be reusable.

before the next update
- depthbuffer, water, some dumb npc, 1 new (channel/charge) skill per class, day-cycle + timesync,
 iso-maps, online characters to synch on login, add collision handler on server for
 tree base, on collision server sends message to remove projectile with the id.
 add tree-sync, windowed support, configuration file: game.cfg, 

TODO}
 depth buffering
 generate encryption keys at splash
 game.exe - bringToFront, sometimes its not when launched from launcher!!!
 rework the patcher for linux support.
 rework the patcher for TPacket support.
 tag all source files.
 serialize to TIdBytes not String!
 message header contains length, read length. - repeat, if received len > maxpacksize drop all.
 ! server adjusts player positioning when the player does not move, merge the vectors!
	the server calculates the players "dir" based on the last waypoint?

BUG}
- Gif spinner not always shown in StatusBox!
- when a sever is "Full" (status), no logins can be done?
- when a server is Full (quota), accounts can connect and log in.
- when player dies, does not always fall dead, animation fails to start, but hitpacket is recvd..
- goblins seems to fire when they are dead? hp = 0, these projectiles does not damage the player


REMINDERS}
cleaner ui -> less text colors



THOUGHTS}
players can summon stuff that follow them around, or send foul beasts onto their enemies
with the AI model. 
during beta test: allow the server admin account to spawn enemies. :D:D:D
clean project and refactor please.
the spellbuffer (casttime) is just a time -delay buffer? while in buffer, targets may or may not move.
add softbards (show delta +-) on healthbars? 
seeking spell: conjures some orbs that will search out nearby targets, friendly and otherwise
  the orbs has a maximum turning angle, so they are avoidable, when a target is offseted by an angle
  larger than x, the orb dies. the orbs will lock to nearest player at cast-time. players hit are slowed or smh  

the maps might need to be revised, 1:1 maps are too big, create objects and texture.

a silence should disrupt any spells currently being casted (except non silenceable spells)
 display location at server selection, and main frame as debugtestdata, region (EU, US, AS) 
 if myversion differ from the reported server version at server login show error
	message: "Running Version 3.0 which is incompatible with Server 2.9" (major version) trunc+compare
	+ " checking for updates.." + check for updates and display spinner, if a new version is found then
 	show message (Update to version X available, please restart and run the launcher to install.)

 all components called with DRAW from ENGINE must take alpha as parameter,
	engine uses TBlend?

spell casting modes: 
- instant: casted instantly: buffs, special abilities
- channeled: damages periodically; chain lighning, aoe heals, drains
- charged: thief draw arrow, heals, spells

need to be able to change map while inside a map.
need to gain multiplayer data when they join the map, xy, health, name etc
progress bar, checkbox GUI Componenets GLGUI

server rules for spawning trees,no trees may be too near eachothertrees should spawn in predefined conf files


if not game.cfg found recreate with:
